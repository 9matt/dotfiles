# dotfiles 
This is a backup of my dotfiles, includes configs for all the programs I use. 

# Alacritty
Alacritty is my preferred terminal emulator. Uses the colors from the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/alacritty/) theme and the background from the Aritim Dark theme.

# Termite
Also including my Termite config, this terminal uses the same theming as my Alacritty config. 

# Shells
I am currently using zsh as my main shell. Also including my old fish config and a simple bash config. Some functions are stolen from Luke Smith's config.  

# Picom
Including my simple config for the [Jonaburg fork of picom](https://github.com/jonaburg/picom). This is the sample config with some features disabled. I use this with [my build of dwm](https://github.com/9matt/dwm). 

# Vimb & Homepage
My config for the [vimb](https://fanglingsu.github.io/vimb) minimal browser. Also includes the custom css and a homepage - [tilde](https://github.com/cadejscroggins/tilde)

# Dunst
I'm using dunst for my notifications, and for the tuxi dmenu search script. It's themed to match the rest of the system.
